## Notes

### Null Pointer and `Segmentation fault`

- Segmentation fault: 
    > Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that â€œdoes not belong to you
- NULL Pointer
    > People assign NULL to pointer to indicate that it points to nothing.

### Read Only String and its Dynamical type

- `char* str` Read only: able to share among functions
    ```c
    char *str = "gfg"; 
    ```
    Read only. `str[0]=a` leads to segmentation fault. Noted that read-only string can be passed among functions:
    ```c
    char *getString(){
    char *str = "GfG"; /* Stored in read only part of shared segment */

    /* No problem: remains at address str after getString() returns*/
    return str; 
    }	 

    int main(){
    printf("%s", getString()); 
    getchar();
    return 0;
    }

    ```
- `char str[]` Mutable string: unable to share among functions.
    ```c
    int main(){
        char str[];
        str = "gfg";
    }
    ```
- Store in heap: allow to share and modify
    ```c
    char *getString()
    {
    int size = 4;
    char *str = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char)*size); /*Stored in heap segment*/
    *(str+0) = 'G'; 
    *(str+1) = 'f';  
    *(str+2) = 'G';
    *(str+3) = '\0';  
    
    /* No problem: string remains at str after getString() returns */   
    return str;  
    }     
    int main()
    {
    printf("%s", getString());  
    getchar();
    return 0;
    }
    ```
